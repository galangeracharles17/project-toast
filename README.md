# Toast Component Project

## Joy of React, Project II

This project, is a single common UI component: A `<Toast>` message component.

I approached this project in a freestyle way to learn and to improve my logical thinking and problem solving.

## Additional feature that I added

- Tab selection on radio buttons
- Escape key to erase all toast messages
- Screen reader support on button

## What did I learn?

- React hooks
- Handling React states
- State management using `React.createContext`
- Breaking down the function into a more manageable structure
- Analyzing the project before implementation
- Logical thinking on how to implement certain features
- Problem-solving on how to solve a specific problem

### If you are interested, you can follow these steps

```bash
# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Run a development server:
npm run dev
```

To create new components, you can use this helper script.

```bash
# Create a new component:
npm run new-component [TheNewComponentName]
```

> I think that's all! It was a great project, and I really enjoyed the process of creating it.
